<p>For the national landmark topic, I chose a photo of the Statue of Liberty. It is located in New York Harbor in New
    York. It was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Bartholdi.</p>

<h2>Dog breed</h2>
<a href="image2.html"><img src="img/thumb_corgi.jpg" alt="A jumping Corgi" width="150" height="100" /></a>
<p>I chose Corgi for my second topic. It is one of my favorite dog breeds because they always look energetic. It is a
    cattle herding dog breed.</p>

<h2>Car model</h2>

<p>It is a 2016 Jeep Wrangler. Its MPG is 17/21 (city/hwy). Horsepower is 285hp. Fuel tank capacity is 18.9 gal.</p>

<h2>Actor</h2>
<a href="image4.html"><img src="img/thumb_dwayne-johnson.jpg" alt="Dwayne Johnson" width="150" height="150" /></a>
<p>For the actor topic, I chose a photo of Dwayne Johnson. He is also known as The Rock. Before starting his acting
career, he was a professional wrestler.</p>

<h2>Potato Chips</h2>
<a href="image5.html"><img src="img/thumb_ruffles_cheddar.jpg" alt="Ruffles Cheddar and Sour Cream" width="150"
                           height="150" /></a>
<p>My fifth topic is my favorite choice of chip. I like to have Ruffles cheddar and sour cream flavored chips when binge watching
a tv show. Thick and wave cut potato chip are the reasons I like it.</p>
